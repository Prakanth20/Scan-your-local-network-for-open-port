# 🔍 Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports using Nmap (`-sS` TCP SYN Scan)

This guide explains how to use Nmap’s TCP SYN scan (`-sS`) to scan your local network for open ports. TCP SYN scan is the default and most popular scan option in Nmap. It’s fast, stealthy, and effective.

---

## 📌 What is `-sS`?

`-sS` tells Nmap to perform a **TCP SYN scan**, often referred to as a "half-open" scan because it doesn't complete the TCP handshake. It sends a SYN packet and waits for a response:

- `SYN-ACK` = Port is **open**
- `RST` = Port is **closed**
- No response or filtered = Possibly **filtered/firewalled**

---

## 📦 Requirements

- **OS:** Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **Nmap Installed:**
  - **Linux:** `sudo apt install nmap`
  - **macOS:** `brew install nmap`
  - **Windows:** [Download here](https://nmap.org/download.html)

## 🔧 Usage

### 1. Identify Your Local IP and Subnet

Run:

- **Linux/macOS:**
  ```bash
  ip a
  ```

* **Windows (CMD/PowerShell):**

  ```bash
  ipconfig
  ```

Example:
If your IP is `192.168.1.100` with subnet `/24`, the network range is likely:

```
192.168.1.0/24
```

---

### 2. Run the TCP SYN Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24
```

> 🔑 `sudo` is required for raw packet scanning.

---

## 📝 Output Explanation

Nmap will return a list of live hosts and their open TCP ports:

```
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.10
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
443/tcp  open  https
```

---

## 💡 Optional Enhancements

* **Add OS detection & service version:**

  ```bash
  sudo nmap -sS -A 192.168.1.0/24
  ```

* **Save output to file:**

  ```bash
  sudo nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24 -oN scan_results.txt
  ```

* **Faster scan (less accurate timing):**

  ```bash
  sudo nmap -sS -T4 192.168.1.0/24
  ```

## ⚠️ Legal Warning

> ⚠️ **Only scan networks that you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.**
